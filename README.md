# Lottery System 
## _Simple Smart Contract for lottery system_

Very simple implementation of a Smart Contract for lottery system.

## Features

- ERC20 Smart Contract for QuiniCoin (QNI) token (in a warm tribute to the Argentinean gambling game called Quini6)
- Token management functions (get price, generate new tokens, buy tokens, get balance, get jackpot, get my tokens)
- Lottery management (buy ticket, get my tickets, generate winning ticket, swap tokens)


## Tech

- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) - Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Remix IDE is an open source web and desktop application. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.
